The figures inside directories below this were used to construct most of the figures and tables in this book. They are split up with one directory per chapter. Inside each chapter directory you will find a csv and a working directory:

- **csv** - These contain the CSV files that scripts use to generated the figures of the same name. Not every figure in the book is created in this way but most of them are. The ones that were created manually, often using LibreOffice, wil be in the working directory.
- **working** - These contain spreadsheets which show exactly how source data was processed to yield the CSV files in the csv directory. The name of the sheets will correspond to the names of the CSV files and figure filenames in the book. There are also spreadsheets and other files here which were used to create the minority of figures that were created manually, ie without using the CSV processing scripts.

Figures that were not updated will not be in the secondedition directory, see the firstedition direcory.
